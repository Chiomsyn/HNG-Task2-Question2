This program was written purely in Kotlin PL using Android Studio IDE.
It accepts user input on an EditText and displays it on an
AlertDialog box. On the app there is also link that redirects you to zuri's
Homepage when it is clicked.
You can also test the app yourself on appetite.io on the below link

variable.
